                        <p>Kimchi (김치) is a collective term for vegetable dishes that have been salted, seasoned, and fermented. The its history goes back to ancient times. Originated from pickled vegetables, there are now hundreds of kimchi varieties in Korea. You can find some of the most common ones in my 15 easy kimchi recipes.
Over the last decade or so, Korean kimchi has gained a global recognition as a healthy probiotic food. It’s a good source of useful lactic acid bacteria, has excellent anti-oxidation and anti-cancer effects, and helps prevent aging.</p>

                        <p>Jajangmyeon (자장면), also called jjajangmyeon (짜장면), is a noodle dish in a black bean sauce. Along with jjamppong (짬뽕, spicy seafood noodle soup) and tangsuyuk (탕수육, sweet and sour pork or beef), it’s a popular Korean-Chinese dish. Called collectively as Junghwa Yori (중화요리), Korean-Chinese cuisine was developed by early Chinese immigrants in Korea. It’s a huge part of Korean food culture.
Growing up, jajangmyeon was the dish that our parents treated us with on special occasions, such as graduation, exam days, birthdays, etc. It was every child’s favorite food! Still probably is.</p>

It’s extremely popular as a nourishing food which helps fight the summer heat. As the Korean saying goes, eating the hot soup is “fighting the heat with heat.”Hope you get to enjoy samgyetang before the summer goes by. But, don’t worry about it even if you don’t get to, this ginseng soup is a nutritious, comfort food which you can enjoy all year around!

Everything you need is all in one bowl!One of my favourite ways of beating the summer heat is having Bibim Naengmyeon (비빔냉면). If you translate these words in plain English, it means ‘cold mixed noodles’.As with Bibimbap (Korean mixed rice), the words “Bibim (mixed)” often project “SPICY” even though it is not necessarily the case all the time. So, Bibim Naengmyeon is often described as Korean spicy cold noodles.A lot of Koreans love eating Bibim Naengmyeon in summer because it’s served cold. Sometimes, it’s even served with shredded ice made with beef broth. For sure, you will be forgetting that it’s summer while you’re eating these noodles </p>

                        <p> Bulgogi (불고기)Bulgogi (불고기), also known as Korean BBQ beef, is marinated thinly sliced beef, typically cooked over an open flame. “Bul” means fire in Korean, and “gogi” is a general term for meat. While there are other variations such as chicken and pork, the term generally refers to beef bulgogi.While Korean beef BBQ is most commonly char grilled at restaurants, there are many regional variations as to how this dish is prepared and served. In this bulgogi recipe, I’m also introducing Seoul-style bulgogi (서울식 불고기), which is how I used to eat bulgogi growing up. It’s also known as yetnal bulgogi (옛날불고기), meaning old-style or from the past. It’s a particular way the marinated meat is served up. Over the last decade or so, it has made a remarkable comeback and become very popular throughout the country. My family loves it! </p>

It’s minimalist kimbap that’s addictive.This child-size gimbap (or kimbap) is called ggoma gimbap (꼬마김밥) because of its small size. Ggoma means a little one or little kid in Korean. It’s also known as mayak kimbap (마약김밥). Mayak means narcotic drugs, so the name comes from this gimbap’s reputation for being addictive. It’s a specialty of Gwangjang Market (광장시장), a bustling, crowded market in the center city of Seoul, where the merchants came up with the idea to serve these little guys with a sweet and tangy hot mustard sauce. It’s this sauce that makes the gimbap addictive.</p>

Eomuk (aka odeng, 오뎅) is processed fish cake made with pureed fish and other ingredients. It’s a common ingredient used in various Korean dishes such as gimbap and eomuk bokkeum. The street version of eomuk guk (soup) is conveniently served on long skewers with the hot broth served separately in a cup. At home, eomuk guk can be prepared without skewers as an easy everyday soup!This dish originates from the iconic Japanese dish called “oden” which is a stew made with fish cakes and many other delicacies. The Korean version is much simpler, made mostly with fish cakes and radish. Oddly enough, Koreans call fish cakes “odeng” not the dish itself.</p>

All the contrasting flavors work so well together to create something incredibly flavorful and comforting.I recently enjoyed seafood cheese ttoekbokki at a Korean restaurant in K-town New York. It was delicious, so I’ve recreated it here for you!Cheese didn’t exist in Korea in the past. The only cheese I knew growing up was American yellow cheese singles. Driven by the young generation, cheese consumption has been rapidly rising in Korea over the last two decades as Western dishes such as pizza have become enormously popular.

                        <p>Hotteok (호떡),otteok basically is a pan-fried yeast dough stuffed with a brown sugar and nut filling.There are many variations, but the classic hotteok we grew up on is made with a simple yeast dough with a brown sugar and nut filling and pan-fried in a little bit of oil. This recipe is my modern take on the classic version.The types of hotteok continue to evolve — thanks to street food vendors! It seems like every time I go to Korea I learn about a new variation or two. There are all sorts of different sweet and savory fillings such as red beans, cheese, vegetables, japchae, etc.The dough has become very complex, as vendors strive to achieve the best flavor and texture. Many vendors now deep-fry their hotteok. Of course, deep-frying makes everything more delicious, but I prefer pan-frying.

The word dalgona came from the casual Korean word “dalguna (달구나)” meaning “it’s sweet.” It’s also called ppopgi (뽑기), which means to pick or select, referring to the game and reward aspect of this candy offered by the vendors.Similar to honeycomb toffee candy, dalgona is basically made by melting sugar and stirring in a little bit of baking soda. The sugar mixture then foams up and turns into something that looks like light caramel-colored whipped cream.This is the part that resembles the whipped coffee.</p>

                        <p> Korean corn dogs or Korean hot dogs are popular local street food, typically made of sausages or mozzarella cheese (or both together) on sticks wrapped with yeasted batter and coated with Panko breadcrumbs then deep-fried to golden. They are then dusted with sugar and drizzled with ketchup and yellow mustard.The most well-known variation is the 'gamja-hotdog' (gamja=potato or french fries) wherein, aside from the usual coating, the corn dog is also covered with french fries bits.There is also the mozzarella cheese corn dog, where a thick mozzarella stick is used, instead of a sausage. If you can't decide between the two, you can have them both in one. Cut the hotdog in half and place it on a skewer, then place the mozzarella stick next.It is not limited to sausages and mozzarella, other variations use spam, (injneolmi) rice cake, fish cakes, squid, and cheddar cheese

                       <p>Soju is a distilled spirit from Korea that's traditionally made from rice. It may be made from sweet potato, barley, tapioca, or wheat or any combination of the ingredients.<br>
                        The clear alcoholic beverage is sometimes called Korean vodka because of its neutral flavor. Though it's long been a favorite drink in Korea and is a perfect pairing for Korean cuisine, soju is enjoying increased popularity in the West.<br>
                        There is a customary way to drink it and you can enjoy it straight or use it to make cocktails. </p>
